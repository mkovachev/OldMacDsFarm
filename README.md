# OldMacsFarm

"Old MacDonald Had a Farm" is a children's song and nursery rhyme about a farmer named MacDonald and the five animals he keeps in his farm. He has a duck, a dog, a cat, a cow and a sheep. And each verse of the song changes the name of the animal and its respective noise.

For Example:

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!
And on his farm he had a **cow**, E-I-E-I-O!
With a **moo-moo** here and a **moo-moo** there,
Here a **moo**, there a **moo**,
Everywhere a **moo-moo**,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!
